This paper addresses some of the topic matter covered in research and activity this week. Be sure to include reference links below to the research and information you used to complete this assignment.

## Topic: Activity Diagrams
Professional developers have the ability to understand simple UML sketch diagrams. It's essential to understand some of the fundamental symbols to communicate well with others. 

Update the information below to demonstrate your knowledge on this topic.   

**1. Common Symbols.**

Describe what each UML symbol outlined below is used for in an Activity Diagram. 

**The last bullet provides an example**.

* Diamond: [ The decision symbol that shows a split in actions based on a condition.  ] 
* Solid Circle: [ initial node, entry point of the process. ] 
* Solid Line and Arrow: [ The control flow which shows the direction of the process ]
* Dotted Line and Text connecting to a Diamond: [ the condition ]
* Rectangle: [ shows an action. ]
* Solid Circle surrounded by another Circle: [ Final node, shows where the process ends. ]
* A symbol called "Fork": [ splits a flow into multiple concurrent flows. ]
* **A symbol called "Join"**: A join is a solid line that denotes where two possible steps in a program flow resolve to the same next step. 


**2. Linear vs Non-Linear**

What is the difference between a linear and non-linear process? 

[ A linear process is a sequence of events that must happen in order. A nonlinear process is a series of actions and decisions that can occur in any order. ]


## Topic: Class Diagrams
UML can also be used to create class diagrams. Respond below to show your understanding of this topic.   

**1. List at least three symbols that denote Accessibility (aka Visibility) in a Class Diagram.**

[ Public − A public member is visible from anywhere in the system. In class diagram, it is prefixed by the symbol ‘+’.

Private − A private member is visible only from within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class. A private member is prefixed by the symbol ‘−’.

Protected − A protected member is visible from within the class and from the subclasses inherited from this class, but not from outside. It is prefixed by the symbol ‘#’.]



**2. What does the term "Attributes" mean in a Class Diagram? Provide one or more examples.**

[ Structural features(attributes) define what objects of the class know. In domain modeling class diagrams, an attribute represents a data definition for an instance of a classifier. An attribute describes a range of values for that data definition. A classifier can have any number of attributes or none at all. Attributes describe the structure and value of an instance of a class.]
    

**3. What does the term "Operations" mean in a Class Diagram? Provide one or more examples.**

[ Operations are the processes that a class knows to carry out. Operations most obviously correspond to the methods on a class. At the specification level, operations correspond to public methods on a type. Normally, you don't show those operations that simply manipulate attributes, because they can usually be inferred. ]



**4. What is the benefit of defining a minimum set of requirements at the beginning of a project? Also explain the what the term "minimum viable product" means in development.**  

 [ The benefit of defining the minimum set of requirements at the beginning is to have just what is needed and nothing more. With having just the basic features to be usable by early customers who can provide feedback. Which is why we use MVP(Minimum Viable Product) that means a development technique in which a new product is introduced in the market with basic features. ]

It is acceptable to provide multiple links for a single topic and to use material provided to you in this class. You are encouraged to link to your own independent research as well. 

[All i did was a simple google search however, I found the activity diagram website to be most helpful simpley because how they lay out the informaction. This make it easy to find what i needed.]
